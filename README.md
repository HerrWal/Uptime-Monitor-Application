# Uptime Monitor Application
 RESTful API for an uptime monitor application

Allows users to enter URLs they want monitored, and receive alerts when those resources "go down" or "come back up."

The app should be useable, so we'll include features such as user sign-up and sign-in.

We'll also include functionality for sending an SMS alert to user, rather than email via Twilio API.
